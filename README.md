# precious-metal-prices
A quickly kludged python module for pulling up-to-date precious metal prices that uses beautifulsoup and urllib. 

I couldn't find a readily accessible example for pulling prices of precious metals in USD, so I made this in an evening.

This module can pull prices in USD for gold, silver, platinum, and palladium in grams, troy ounces, and kilograms.

This module scrapes price info from the first site that seemed easy for me to scrape. If the site used changes, this will likely break. 

I make no guarantees regarding the pricing data that is provided by this script. If you're looking for hyper-accurate and timely pricing data, I would look into commercially available APIs.
