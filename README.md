# precious-metal-prices
A quickly kludged module for pulling up-to-date precious metal prices.

I couldn't find a readily accessible example for pulling prices of precious metals in USD, so I made my own in an evening.

This module scrapes price info from the first site that seemed easy for me to scrape.

If the site used changes, this will likely break. I don't guarantee the accuracy of the pricing provided by this script. If you're looking for hyper-accurate and timely pricing data, I would look into commercially available APIs.
